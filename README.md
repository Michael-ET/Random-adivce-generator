# Random-adivce-generator
The dodgy mechanic adivce generator was one of my first projects learning basic javascript
and HTML. It's a simple application that holds strings within three arrays, randomly selects 
one from each and joins them together to form a sentence.

I wanted to include this as a portfolio project so revisited the code to add a stlyed homepage 
in order to make it a useable application.
